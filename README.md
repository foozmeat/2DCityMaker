### Installation

To make things easy the generator runs inside of [LÃ–VE 2D](https://love2d.org/). You'll need to download it and then drop this folder onto their app.

### Usage

The map generator makes use of a BSP Tree to subdivide the map into city blocks. You can customize the dimensions of the map as well as the width of the street lanes. The BSPNode class should stand on its own since it's priarily concerned with geometry and not graphics.

### Places to go

There are a few things that would make this generator more interesting

* Building generation
* Water features like lakes and rivers
* Address generation

### Contributions
